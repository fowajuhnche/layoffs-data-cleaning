SQL project for cleaning and standardizing layoffs data

🚀 Just wrapped up my first SQL data cleaning project! 🚀
I'm really excited to share that I’ve completed my first project focused on cleaning and preparing layoffs data for analysis. It’s been a great learning experience, and I picked up some solid SQL skills along the way!
Here’s what I did:
 1️⃣ Removed duplicates – Used ROW_NUMBER() to spot and clean duplicate entries.
 2️⃣ Standardized data – Cleaned up inconsistencies in company names, industries, and dates using functions like TRIM(), STR_TO_DATE(), and UPDATE.
 3️⃣ Handled missing values – Replaced blanks with NULLs and filled in missing details using JOIN operations.
 4️⃣ Tidied up the dataset – Removed extra columns that were no longer needed after cleaning.
Key SQL techniques I used:
ROW_NUMBER() to identify duplicates
JOIN to fill missing data
UPDATE for data standardization
DELETE to clean up unnecessary records
